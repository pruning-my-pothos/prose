    <p>
      Pruning My Pothos is a reading-first execution journal. It separates applied practice, philosophical thinking, and
      working notes so you can decide how deep to go. It is not a résumé or a portfolio.
    </p>

    <h2>Working style</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with the narrative, then build the smallest useful artifact.</li>
      <li>Pair execution with documentation so future contributors have context.</li>
      <li>Ship in calm environments with crisp constraints and measurable outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What lives here</h2>
    <p>
      Practice holds examined execution. Philosophy explores systems, AI, work, and meaning. Working Notes capture
      experiments and drafts that may grow into the other sections. Documentation lives in verse and covers the writing
      and technical systems behind the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Trajectory</h2>
    <p>
      I started in communications, moved into product delivery, and now blend systems thinking with hands-on build work. The throughline is clarity: say the thing plainly, ship the smallest useful version, then iterate with context.
