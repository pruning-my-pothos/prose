hypothesis: New hires ramp faster when they receive sequenced, role-specific slices instead of the full handbook.
build_notes: Parsed the handbook into structured topics, tagged by role, and generated three-week learning paths.
next_iteration: Connect progress tracking and short quizzes to keep engagement high.
