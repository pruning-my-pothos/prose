Urgency feels productive until you realize the team is living in a permanent red zone. The work gets loud, decisions get reactive, and nothing compounds.

I prefer designing for calm throughput. That means fewer handoffs, clearer definitions of done, and artifacts that stand on their own. Momentum appears when people trust the system enough to focus on their craft instead of fighting fires.

Calm does not mean slow. It means steady speed with room for reflection, which is the only way to notice the signals that point toward the next good decision. Sprints still matter, but they work best on top of a system that already hums.
