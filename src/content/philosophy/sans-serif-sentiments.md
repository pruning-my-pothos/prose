Sans Serif Sentiments is how I describe my approach to writing, communication, and explanation.

Sans serif fonts remove decorative strokes. They prioritize legibility over flourish. They are not emotionless. They are restrained. They trust structure to carry meaning instead of embellishment.

I apply the same principle to language.

> Remove ornament. Expose the logic. Let the reader breathe.

Much of professional communication fails not because the ideas are complex, but because the writing is burdened with performance. Sentences become padded to sound intelligent. Concepts are wrapped in metaphor to avoid precision. Ambiguity is mistaken for depth.

I prefer writing that removes friction. That does not mean simplifying ideas until they are shallow. It means expressing them without unnecessary decoration. It means choosing words for accuracy, not effect. It means allowing pauses, white space, and structure to do work that adjectives often try to do poorly.

A sans serif approach:

- respects the reader’s time
- makes assumptions explicit
- separates explanation from opinion
- avoids urgency when clarity is required

This applies equally to philosophy, documentation, and corporate communication. An incident update should be as readable as an essay. A system design should be explainable without jargon. A reflective piece should not hide behind abstraction.

Sentiment still exists here. It just is not dramatized.

- emotion shows up through restraint
- conviction shows up through consistency
- care shows up through precision

On this site, sans serif sentiments means you will see short paragraphs, direct statements, clear structure, and ideas that stand without rhetorical support. If something feels plain, that is intentional. Plainness is often where thinking becomes visible.
