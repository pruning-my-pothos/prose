I use the phrase Pruning My Pothos to describe how I think about work, learning, and systems.

A pothos grows quickly. If left alone, it spreads in every direction. It looks healthy for a while, but over time it weakens itself. Energy disperses. Growth becomes ornamental rather than intentional.

> Pruning is not about reducing growth. It is about directing it.

Most modern work environments reward visible expansion. More tools. More features. More frameworks. More outputs. The default assumption is that growth equals progress. In practice, this often creates fragility. Teams accumulate decisions they no longer remember making. Systems carry complexity without purpose. People mistake motion for direction.

My approach is to prune deliberately.

- remove ideas that do not serve the problem, even if they are interesting
- choose fewer tools and understand them deeply
- say no to work that adds surface area without increasing clarity

Pruning also applies to thinking. Not every insight deserves to be shared. Not every experiment needs to become a product. Some things exist only to teach you what not to carry forward.

In practical terms, pruning shows up as a set of defaults:

- smaller, intentional artifacts
- clear boundaries between finished work and work in progress
- documentation that explains why something exists, not just how
- fewer decisions made under urgency, more made under calm

> Unpruned potential is not optionality. It is noise.

This site exists as a record of that practice. What you see here is not everything I think or build. It is what remains after subtraction.
