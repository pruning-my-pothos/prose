Welcome to the smidgeon stream. This is a new kind of content on the [Garden](/garden). One that was
overdue. They're called _smidgeons_. Teeny, tiny entries. The kinds of things I used to put in
Tweets, before Twitter died a terrible death.

Most are only a few sentences long. They're mainly links to notable things – good articles, papers,
and ideas. I've been meaning to do this for a while, but a recent migration to
[Astro](https://astro.build/) suddenly made it much easier.
