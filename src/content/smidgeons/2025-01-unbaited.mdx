A browser extension that filters out engagement bait from your feed on Twixxer. Uses Llama 3.3 under
the hood to analyse Tweets in real time and then blurs out sensationalist political content. Or
whatever else you prompt it to blur – the system prompt is editable:

<BasicImage framed width="650" margin="1.5rem auto 2rem" src="/images/smidgeons/unbaited.png" showalt alt="System settings and a customisable prompt for the Unbaited app" />

This is certainly _a way_ to try and manage Twixxer's slow demise into right-wing extremist content.
Though I'm taking this more as a thought experiment and interesting prototype than a sincere
suggestion we should spend precious energy burning GPUs on clickbait filtering. Integrating LLMs
into the browsing experience and using them to selectively curate content for you is the more
interesting move here.
