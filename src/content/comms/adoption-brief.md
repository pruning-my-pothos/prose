The platform relaunch was more than a UI refresh. It reorganized workflows around outcomes customers were already hacking together. To land the change, the story had to be simple and repeatable.

I framed the brief around three moves: clarify the before-and-after, show the new path with a visual, and equip every team with the same language. Sales got a short deck, success got playcards, and support got fast answers to expected objections.

With everyone telling the same story, adoption moved faster than prior launches and the release felt intentional instead of rushed.
