After five years of working with [egghead](https://egghead.io), I decided it was time to move on. I started as an illustrator in early 2016. By 2018 I had moved into an art director and leadership role. By 2020 I'd shifted to focusing on UX and product design.

I grew up in this company, but over the last year it's become clear I need/want to engage more in the rising "tools for thought" ecosystem. I've now joined [HASH](https://hash.ai) as the design lead. We're working on building a knowledge management platform (aka. "note-taking app") backed by schemas and structured data.
