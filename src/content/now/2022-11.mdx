It's a weird week. Twitter is (possibly) entering a slow death march and much of my community is reluctantly slouching over to Mastodon. I've started cross-posting there as well: [indieweb.social/@maggie](https://indieweb.social/@maggie). The Elon-escapades only drive home how important it is to own and control the platform you're publishing to. Which means writing on your own website first and cross-posting to external platforms. The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community has a catchy acronym for this: [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.

I still don't have a Twitter-like stream setup on this site, but I'm working on it. Tools like [WebMentions](https://webmention.io/) and [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) are going to do a lot of the heavy lifting. I'm having trouble finding many tutorials or guides on how to do it though – perhaps another case of writing the piece you want to read.

I've been working at [Ought](https://ought.org/) since late August. The London ↔ SF time difference is a bit crap, but I can't say enough good things about my fellow Oughters 🦦. It's rare and special to work alongside such thoughtful and ambitious people. We're in the middle of designing and prototyping some wildly different interfaces for [Elicit](https://elicit.org/), our AI research assistant and Ought's main product. Users say they love the current version, but we know it could be so much better.

In other news, I bought a cheap, used laser printer and it's drastically improved my reading experience for long articles and PDFs. Can't recommend it enough. There are plenty going for £30-40 on eBay and you'll finally read all those 5000-word blog posts you have bookmarked.

I've finally gotten back into a good writing cadence. I recently published [Programming Portals](/programming-portals) and [Command K Bars](/command-bar). Now I'm slowly chipping away at [Tools for Thought](/tools-for-thought) [as Cultural Practices,](/tools-for-thought) [Not Computational Objects](/tools-for-thought). I've been writing it forever, but that's kind of the point of [gardening](/garden-history) in public. You post up loose skeletons of ideas and flesh them out over time. Nothing forces you to write like knowing people are reading your half-baked version.
