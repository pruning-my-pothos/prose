The radios crackle and the harbor hums like a patient animal. Screens glow in blues and greens, plotting cargo that never sleeps. The dispatcher counts tides and truck queues, sipping coffee that tastes like metal.

Out on the water, pilots steer hulks of steel through narrow teeth of light. The job is to keep everything threaded: channel markers, crew changes, customs calls. A missed slot ripples across the coast.

When dawn pushes a pale line across the bay, the dispatcher shuts the logbook. The city wakes, unaware of the quiet choreography that kept its shelves full.
